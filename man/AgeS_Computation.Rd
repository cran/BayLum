\bold{NUMERICAL OUTPUT}

\enumerate{
\item \bold{A list containing the following objects:}
 \itemize{
  \item \bold{Sampling}: that corresponds to a sample of the posterior distributions
 of the age (in ka), palaeodose (in Gy) and equivalent dose dispersion (in Gy) parameters for each sample;
  \item \bold{Model_GrowthCurve}: stating which dose response fitting option was chosen;
  \item \bold{Distribution}: stating which distribution was chosen to model the dispersion of
 individual equivalent dose values around the palaeodose of the sample;
  \item \bold{PriorAge}: stating the priors used for the age parameter (in ka);
  \item \bold{StratiConstraints}: stating the stratigraphic relations between samples considered in the model;
  \item \bold{CovarianceMatrix}: stating the covariance matrix of error used in the model, highlighting common errors between samples or not.
 }
  \item\bold{The Gelman and Rubin test of convergency}: prints the result of the Gelman and Rubin test of convergency for
the age, palaeodose and equivalent dose dispersion parameters for each sample.
A result close to one is expected.\cr
In addition, the user must visually assess the convergency of the trajectories by looking at the graph
generated by the function (see \bold{PLOT OUTPUT} for more informations).\cr
If both convergencies (Gelman and Rubin test and plot checking) are satisfactory,
the user can consider the estimates as valid.
Otherwise, the user may try increasing the number of MCMC interations (\code{Iter})
or being more precise on the \code{PriorAge} parameter (for example specify if it is a young sample \code{c(0.01,10)} an old sample \code{c(10,100)}),
or changing the parameter \code{distribution} or the growth curve, to reach convergency.
  \item \bold{Credible intervals and Bayes estimates}: prints the Bayes esitmates, the credible intervals at 95\% and 68\% for
the age, palaeodose and equivalent dose dispersion parameters for each sample.
}

\bold{PLOT OUTPUT}

\enumerate{
 \item\bold{MCMC trajectories}: A graph with the MCMC trajectories and posterior distributions of the age, palaeodose and equivalent dose dispersion parameters
is displayed, there is one page per sample. \cr
The first line of the figure correponds to the age parameter, the second to the palaeodose parameter
and the third to the equivalent dose dispersion parameter.
On each line, the plot on the left represents the MCMC trajectories, and the one on the right the posterior distribution of the parameter.
 \item \bold{Summary of sample age estimates}: plot credible intervals and Bayes estimate of each sample age on a same graph.
}

To give the results in a publication, we recommend to give the Bayes estimate of the parameters as well as the credible interval at 95\% or 68\%.

\description{
This function computes the age (in ka) of at least two samples according to the model developed in Combes and Philippe (2017),
based on outputs of \code{\link{Generate_DataFile}} or \code{\link{Generate_DataFile_MG}}
or both of them using \code{\link{combine_DataFiles}}.\cr
Samples, for which data is avalilable in several BIN files, can be analysed.\cr
Single-grain or Multi-grain OSL measurements can be analysed simultaneouly.
}
\details{
\bold{** How to fill} \code{StratiConstraints} \bold{? **}\cr

If there is stratigraphic relations between samples, \bold{informations in DATA must be ordered by order of increasing ages}.
To do this the user can either fill right \code{Names} in \code{\link{Generate_DataFile}} or in \code{\link{Generate_DataFile_MG}}
(as it is indicated in Details section of these function), or ordered by order of increasing ages
outputs of \code{\link{Generate_DataFile}} or \code{\link{Generate_DataFile_MG}} in \code{\link{combine_DataFiles}}.

The user can fill the \code{StratiConstraints} matrix as follow.
\enumerate{
 \item \bold{Size of the matrix}: row number of \code{StratiConstraints} matrix is equal to \code{Nb_sample+1},
and column number is equal to \code{Nb_sample}.
 \item \bold{First line of the matrix}:
for all \code{i in {1,...,Nb_Sample}}, \code{StratiConstraints[1,i]=1} that means the lower bound of the sample age (given in \code{PriorAge[2i-1]})
for the sample whose number ID is equal to \code{i}, is taken into account.
 \item \bold{Sample relations}: for all  \code{j in {2,...,Nb_Sample+1}} and all \code{i in {j,...,Nb_Sample}},
\code{StratiConstraints[j,i]=1} if sample age whose number ID is equal to \code{j-1} is lower than sample age whose number ID is equal to \code{i}.
Otherwise, \code{StratiConstraints[j,i]=0}.
}
Note that \code{StratiConstraints_{2:Nb_sample+A,1:Nb_sample}} is a upper triangular matrix.

The user can also use \code{\link{SCMatrix}} or \code{\link{SC_Ordered}} (if all samples are ordered) functions
to construct the \code{StratiConstraints} matrix.

The user can also refer to a csv file that containts the relation between samples as defined above.
The user must take care about the separator used in the csv file using the argument \code{sepSC}.\cr

\bold{** How to fill} \code{THETA} \bold{covariance matrix concerning common and individual error? **}\cr

If systematic errors are considered, the user can fill the \code{THETA} matrix as follow.
\itemize{
 \item row number of \code{THETA} is equal the column number, equal to \code{Nb_sample}.
 \item For all \code{i in {1,...,Nb_sample}}, \code{THETA[i,i]} containts individual error
 plus systematic error of the sample whose number ID is equal to \code{i}.
 \item For all \code{i,j in {1,...,Nb_sample}} and \code{i} different from \code{j} ,
\code{THETA[i,j]} containts common error between samples whose number ID are equal to \code{i} and \code{j}.
}
Note that \code{THETA[i,j]} is a symetric matrix.

The user can also refer to a .csv file that containts the errors as defined above.\cr

\bold{** Option on growth curves **}\cr

As for \code{\link{Age_Computation}} and \code{\link{Palaeodose_Computation}}, the user can choose from 4 dose response curves:
\itemize{
  \item \bold{Saturating exponential plus linear growth} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPLIN}):

  for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+cx+d}; select
  \itemize{
    \item \code{LIN_fit=TRUE}
    \item \code{Origin_fit=FALSE}
  }
  \item \bold{Saturating exponential growth} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXP}):

  for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+d}; select
  \itemize{
    \item \code{LIN_fit=FALSE}
    \item \code{Origin_fit=FALSE}
  }
  \item \bold{Saturating exponential plus linear growth and fitting through the origin} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPLINZO}):

  for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+cx}; select
  \itemize{
    \item \code{LIN_fit=TRUE}
    \item \code{Origin_fit=TRUE}
  }
  \item \bold{Saturating exponential growth and fitting through the origin} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPZO}):

  for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))}; select
  \itemize{
    \item \code{LIN_fit=FALSE}
    \item \code{Origin_fit=TRUE}
  }
}

\bold{** Option on equivalent dose distribution around the palaeodose **}\cr

The use can choose between :
\itemize{
  \item \code{cauchy}: a Cauchy distribution with location parameter equal to the palaeodose of the sample;
  \item \code{gaussian}: a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the palaeodose of the sample;
  \item \code{lognormal_A}: a log-normal distribution with mean or \bold{A}verage equal to the palaeodose of the sample:
  \item \code{lognormal_M}: a log-normal distribution with \bold{M}edian equal to the palaeodose of the sample.
}
}
\note{
Please note that the initial values for all MCMC are currently all the same for all chains since we rely on the automatic
initial value generation of JAGS. This is not optimal and will be changed in future. However, it does not affect the quality
of the age estimates if the chains have converged.
