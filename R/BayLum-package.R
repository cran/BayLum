#' @title Chronological Bayesian Models Integrating Optically Stimulated Luminescence and C-14 Dating
#'
#' @description A collection of various R functions for Bayesian analysis of luminescence data and C-14 age estimates.
#' This includes, amongst others, data import, export, application of age and palaeodose models.

#' @details This package is based on the functions: [Generate_DataFile] and [Generate_DataFile_MG]
#' to import luminisecence data. These functions create a list containing all informations to compute age
#' of Single-grain OSL measurements for the first function and Multi-grain OSL measurements for the second.
#'
#' The functions: [Age_Computation] and [AgeS_Computation] use Bayesian analysis for OSL age
#' estimation for one or various samples according to differents models
#' (e.g. different dose-response curves and different equivalent dose distributions around the palaeodose).
#'
#' It is possible to consider various BIN/BINX-files per sample, to compute ages of samples in stratigraphic constraints
#' and to integrate systematic errors.
#'
#' It is possible to calibrate C-14 age with the function [AgeC14_Computation].
#' We can also estimate chronology containing 14C age and OSL samples with the function [Age_OSLC14].
